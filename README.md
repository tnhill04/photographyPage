README FILE

This is my photography page. It shows off some of my portfolio and link to my instragram. 

CSS Features - 

	1. I did a flexbox. I created multiple flexboxes to give the style of my page so the main content was separated into two 
	boxes along with the nav and header below. The header and navbar to be its own box in the mobile view. The main content to 
	be next to each other in its own box below.

    Check Viewpoints of Default, 1024px, and 768px Each has a different color.

    On viewpoint 1024px I used reverse-row to swap the flexboxes
	
	2. I did an animation of the logo so the background color changes to a coupple of colors and stops on a cream color.
	
	Java Features - 
	
	1. In one of my Flexchild divs with the "<h1>Random Pictures of My Photography</h1>" I did math in Java so that each time you see the 
	site it would make one of my photos randomally come up.
